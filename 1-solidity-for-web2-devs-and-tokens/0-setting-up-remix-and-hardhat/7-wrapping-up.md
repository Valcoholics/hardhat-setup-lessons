Overall, we spent the last section diving into Remix, Hardhat and some basics of solidity. Even though there's a lot of details that are left for us to dive into, we have already created our first script, pushed it to github and got it working on our local system. This is a big step, because it now means you can start understanding the workflow that 'real' Web3 developers use in order to develop.

In the next section, we will start to dive into the specifics of a more complicated smart contract and understand the fundamentals Solidity.

## Summary
In this section you:

- Learned how to use Remix and Hardhat
- Made changes to your smart contract
- Wrote a deployment script in Hardhat
- Deployed to your local test network
