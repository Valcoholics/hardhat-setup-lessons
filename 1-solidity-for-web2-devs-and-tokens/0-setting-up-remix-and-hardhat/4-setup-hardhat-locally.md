# Setting Up Hardhat and VSCode for Solidity Development
*Please do the activity below to setup your environment.  If you cannot complete this activity with the video walkthrough, please reach out to your instructor.*

Before we can begin using Hardhat locally, we need to do a few setup steps in order to get a fully functioning environment. The next two lessons will build on this lesson, so please complete the activity fully.

## Steps Required to Setup Hardhat Locally with Git
- Create a new folder for your hardhat work using `mkdir <folder_name>` and `cd` into that folder.
- Create a new node project using `npm init -y`.
- Create a new hardhat project using `npm install --save-dev hardhat`.
- Initialize a new git repository using `git init`.
- Initialize a new hardhat repository using `npx hardhat`. Choose the 'Basic Project' Option. Run any other recommended npm commands as instructed.
- Open the project in VSCode using `code .`.
- Add `Solidity + Hardhat` extension (plus any others you wish) to VSCode.
- Add the file to your `contracts` folder as `UpdatedStorage.sol`. Save this file.
- Create a new repository in your github repository
- Add all of your git changes and commit them to your main branch.
- Create a new Github repository. Push your changes in your local git repository to your remote repository.
