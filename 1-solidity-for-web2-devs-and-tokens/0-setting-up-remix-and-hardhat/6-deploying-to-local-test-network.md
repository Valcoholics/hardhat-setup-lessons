# Deploying To Local Hardhat Node
*In this lesson, please send about 15 minutes going through the full activity to find all the commands you need and executing. The [Hardhat Tutorial Document](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/) will be useful in finishing this lesson. Please add all of your changes to your files and then push to your GitHub repository*

In this final walkthrough lecture, we are going to deploy to a local instance of hardhat we've setup to do local testing. Much like during the previous walkthrough, we're going to deploy our instance of 'UpdatedStorage', but in a way that would allow us to experiment with the script after the fact.

## Steps To Complete
- Setup a local instance of a hardhat node that you can connect to
- Deploy the 'UpdatedScript' to that node
- Open a console to the local node
- Connect to that running instance of the smart contract
- Read the data out
- Change the data in 'storage' and read it again
- Once you believe the script is working, push it to your repository

(Note: in order to complete this, multiple command line instances will be necessary. So don't hesitate to open up multiple terminals.)

#### FIVE MINUTE CONCEPT
Much like the last assignment, you are expected to research what commands you need to use and run them on your own. Please find the commands to do the following:

- Create a Local Node in the CLI
- Create a console that allows you to connect to that node in the CLI
- Deploy an instance of your script to that node in the Console
- Attach to an already running instance of a contract in the Console
- Run a function for a contract in the console

Again, use your classmates in public discussion channels for support!

#### OPTIONAL RESEARCH QUESTIONS
Implicitly, when you attach to an instance of an account, hardhat will automatically connect an account to allow you to run commands. By playing with the console and reviewing the documentation, can you figure out:

- What is the account that hardhat automatically connects to that instance when connecting
- If you wish to explicitly connect an account in the console, what command would you use?
